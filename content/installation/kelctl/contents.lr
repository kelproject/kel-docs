title: kelctl Command-Line Tool Installation
---
body:

To install `kelctl` you need to make sure the follow is true:

* Python 3.5+ installed and working
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) installed and working

It doesn't matter how exactly you have your Python environment setup. This can
be done globally or within a virtual environment. This tool was written in
Python to better integrate with the libraries already written in Python. Due to
it being a cluster admin tool, requring Python is less of an issue, but ideally
this tool should be eventually ported to Go enabling static binaries.

Install `kelctl`:

    pip install kelctl

To confirm the installation, run:

    kelctl --version

You can now move on to [Layer 0](/installation/layer0/) or [Layer 1](/installation/layer1/)
installation guides to make use of `kelctl`.
