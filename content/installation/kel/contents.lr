title: kel Command-Line Tool Installation
---
body:

To install `kel`, run:

    curl -s https://get-kel.kelproject.com | bash

Alternatively, you can download a binary directly and place it on your `$PATH`:

* [`kel-v0.0.1-darwin-amd64`](aaa)
* [`kel-v0.0.1-linux-amd64`](aaa)

To verify the installation worked, run:

    kel --version

You can now move on to deploying a [Python](/), [Django](/) or [Go](/) web app
to make use of `kel`.
