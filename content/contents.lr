Everything you need to know about Kel.

## What is Kel?

Kel is an open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) from Eldarion, Inc. that makes
it easy to manage web application deployment and hosting through the entire
lifecycle from development through testing to production. It adds components and
tools on top of Kubernetes that help developers manage their application
infrastructure. Kel builds on 7+ years experience running one of the leading
Python and Django PaaSes.

## Getting Started

Kel is divided into two parts. We call them layers.

**Layer 0** defines the underlying Kubernetes cluster. Kel provides tooling for
provisioning this layer. Presently, Layer 0 is very opinionated, but over time
we hope to gather interest of the community enabling it to run on other
configurations.

**Layer 1** are the components built to run on **any** Kubernetes cluster. The
result of these components working together enable developers to define a workflow
around managing the operations of their site.
